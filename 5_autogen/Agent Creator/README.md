# Agent Creator

## Overview

**Agent Creator** is an experimental project that demonstrates the autonomous creation and orchestration of AI agents in a distributed runtime using [Autogen Core](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) and [Autogen AgentChat](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen-agentchat). The system is designed to not only generate new, diverse AI agents programmatically, but also to have these agents interact, refine each other's ideas, and operate in a distributed environment.

The project showcases:
- **Meta-creation**: An agent ("Creator") that generates new agent code based on a template, with unique personalities and goals.
- **Distributed runtime**: Agents are registered and run in a distributed fashion using gRPC.
- **Collaborative refinement**: Agents can bounce ideas off each other, leading to emergent, collaborative creativity.
- **Business and creative ideation**: Each agent specializes in a different domain, producing ideas, strategies, or concepts, which are saved as markdown files.

## How It Works

1. **Creator Agent**: The `Creator` agent receives a Python template and, using an LLM, generates new agent code with a unique system message and behavior.
2. **Agent Generation**: The generated code is saved as `agentN.py` files, each representing a new agent with a distinct personality and focus area.
3. **Distributed Orchestration**: The `world.py` script launches a distributed runtime, registers the `Creator`, and instructs it to create and activate multiple agents.
4. **Idea Generation & Collaboration**: Each agent, when prompted, generates an idea (e.g., a business concept, marketing strategy, recipe, etc.). With some probability, the agent will send its idea to another agent for refinement, simulating collaborative brainstorming.
5. **Output**: The final ideas are saved as `ideaN.md` files, one per agent.

## File/Folder Descriptions

### Core Logic

- **`world.py`**  
  Orchestrates the distributed runtime.  
  - Starts a gRPC host and worker.
  - Registers the `Creator` agent.
  - Instructs the `Creator` to generate and register multiple new agents.
  - Prompts each agent to generate an idea, saving the result to `ideaN.md`.

- **`creator.py`**  
  Defines the `Creator` agent, which:
  - Receives a Python template (`agent.py`).
  - Uses an LLM to generate new agent code with a unique system message and behavior.
  - Dynamically imports and registers the new agent with the runtime.
  - Prompts the new agent to generate an idea.

- **`agent.py`**  
  The template for all generated agents.  
  - Defines a base `Agent` class with a customizable system message and behavior.
  - Handles incoming messages, generates ideas, and (with some probability) sends its idea to another agent for refinement.

- **`messages.py`**  
  Defines the `Message` dataclass used for agent communication.
  - Includes a `find_recipient()` function to randomly select another agent for collaborative idea refinement.

### Generated Agents

- **`agent1.py` ... `agent10.py`**  
  Each file is a unique agent generated by the `Creator`.  
  - All inherit from the template in `agent.py`.
  - Each has a distinct system message, interests, and behavioral quirks (e.g., sector focus, personality traits, weaknesses).
  - Example agent types: social media strategist, real estate innovator, sports consultant, marketer, tech consultant, fintech innovator, culinary innovator, business consultant, etc.

---

### Output Files

- **`idea1.md` ... `idea10.md`**  
  Markdown files containing the ideas, strategies, or concepts generated by each agent.  
  - Each file corresponds to the output of one agent.
  - Ideas are diverse, ranging from business concepts and marketing strategies to recipes and investment insights.

---

### Other Files

- **`messages.py`**  
  (See above) Handles message structure and recipient selection.

- **`world.py`**  
  (See above) Main entry point for running the distributed agent creation and idea generation process.

- **`creator.py`**  
  (See above) Implements the meta-agent responsible for generating new agents.

- **`agent.py`**  
  (See above) The agent template used by the `Creator`.

- **`ideaN.md`**  
  (See above) Output files with generated ideas.

- **`ideaX.md`**  
  (Some files may be empty if agent creation or idea generation failed for that agent.)

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Run `world.py`**  
   This will:
   - Start the distributed runtime.
   - Register the `Creator` agent.
   - Instruct the `Creator` to generate 10 new agents.
   - Each agent is prompted to generate an idea, possibly collaborating with another agent.
   - The results are saved as markdown files.

2. **Inspect the Outputs**  
   - Review the generated agent code in `agentN.py`.
   - Read the creative outputs in `ideaN.md`.

## Extending the Project

- **Add More Agents**: Increase `HOW_MANY_AGENTS` in `world.py`.
- **Customize Agent Behavior**: Modify the template in `agent.py` or the system message logic in `creator.py`.
- **Change Collaboration Logic**: Adjust the probability or method for agents to refine each other's ideas.
- **Integrate with Other Runtimes**: Swap out the gRPC runtime for another distributed backend.
